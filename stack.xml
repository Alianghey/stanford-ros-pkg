  <description brief="Packages from the Stanford AI Lab">
    Various packages developed by various authors at the Stanford AI lab. 
    Some are quite functional and stable, and others are obsolete or
    otherwise broken. I have attempted to indicate at least some of their
    status by the top-level directory name.
