  <description brief="ancient_powercube">
    We have this ancient blue Amtec powercube sitting around our lab that 
    still works fine. I doubt there are many other working specimens of this
    vintage, so I'm putting it in its own package, since I believe the RS-232
    protocol is complete different from their newer products.
